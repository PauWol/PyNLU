# Example Folder

This folder serves as a **showcase** for later development and usage examples.

* The `models` folder contains all necessary files required for predictions when the application is deployed.
* These model files are **automatically generated** from a `.yml` configuration file.
* Use this folder as a reference for setting up your own models and understanding the workflow from config to deployment.

> Note: Always ensure your `.yml` configuration file is up-to-date to generate accurate and functional models.
